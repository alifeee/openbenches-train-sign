This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## How to Install

Make sure `gcc` is installed (run `gcc --version`).

Install relevant local platform for local tests `PIO Home > Platforms > Windows x86 > Install v1.2.0`.

Add to platformio.ini file

```ini
[env:windows_x86]
platform = windows_x86
```

Add test file, e.g.,

```cpp
#include <unity.h>
void setUp(void){
    // set stuff up here
}

void tearDown(void){
    // clean stuff up here
}

void test_true_is_true(){
    bool a = true;
    TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(a);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
    UNITY_BEGIN();
    RUN_TEST(test_true_is_true);
    UNITY_END();
}
```

Run tests with

`PlatformIO > Project Tasks > windows_x86 > Advanced > Test`

or

`pio test --environment windows_x86`
